In order to use WORHP, please place all
WORHP binaries, m-files, mex-files, and related
code (e.g., worhp.dll, worhp.lib) in the folder 

\vendor\worhp\WORHP

that you must create. This folder should contain all files
that were distributed to you by WORHP.

The provided function handles in the folder
\vendor\worhp\
will automatically make the correct call to the WORHP class
in the solver folder.
So do NOT change them.

Within FALCON.m, you can call WORHP similar to Ipopt by using:
solver = falcon.solver.worhp(problem);

FALCON.m will automatically add WORHP to your path, if you do
not want to do it by hand.
